# DSA with C++ ðŸš€

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using C++. Each implementation focuses on different techniques, including **queues, stacks, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, and more.**

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
- **Queues** â€“ Implementations of various queue types (array-based, linked list, priority queue, double-ended queue)
- **Stacks** â€“ Stack implementations using arrays and linked lists
- **LinkedLists** â€“ Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists
- **Trees** â€“ Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)
- **Conversions** â€“ Conversion algorithms like Binary to Decimal, Infix to Postfix
- **Sorting** â€“ Sorting algorithms like simple , bubble , insertion , selection binary-insertion
- **Misc** â€“ Other algorithms (Palindrome check, etc.)

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/BeimnetTadesse/DSA-With-Cpp.git
   cd DSA-With-Cpp
